# WebNN external delegate support for Tensorflow.js TFLite

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

This is a new TensorFlow Lite external [Delegate][Delegate] based on
[Web Neural Network API][WebNN] (WebNN), a W3C specification for constructing
and executing computational graphs of neural networks. Under the hood, the WebNN
external delegate C++ implementation is packaged as a standalone WASM module
(Emscripten side module), [dynamically linked][dynamic linking] by the
[`tfjs-tflite`][tfjs-tflite] package, that would enable hardware acceleration of
TensorFlow Lite WebAssembly runtime by leveraging on-device accelerators for
web browsers.

Check out this [demo][demo] where we use this delegate to run a
[MobileNetV2][model] TFLite model on the web.

# Usage

Since this is just a delegate of [`tfjs-tflite`][tfjs-tflite] package, please
refer to the [full usage][tfjs-tflite usage] of [`tfjs-tflite`][tfjs-tflite]
package firstly.

## Load a TFLite model with WebNN external delegate
```js
const tfliteModel = await tflite.loadTFLiteModel(
    'url/to/your/model.tflite',
    {delegatePath: 'url/to/webnn_external_delegate_wasm.wasm'});
```
